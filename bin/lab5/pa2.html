<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

In this assignment you will get practice working with Java arrays,
more practice implementing your own classes, and practice creating a
procedural design in Java (in the <kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd> class).
Like you did in assignment 1 and lab 4, you will be implementing a
class whose specification we have given you, in this case a class
called <kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd>, to represent the board configuration
for a specific type of solitaire game described further below.  You
will also be using tools to help develop correct code, such as
<kbd>assert</kbd> statements along with code to verify that your class
implementation is consistent.
<p>
Note: this program is due after your midterm exam, but it's a fair
amount bigger than the first assignment.  We recommend getting started
on it before the midterm.  It only uses topics from before the
midterm, so working on it now will also help you prepare for the exam
(there will be paper and pencil array programming problems as part of the
exam).
<p>
Note: Lab 5 has some exercises to help you get started on the assignment.
You will need to read over the assignment before completing those exercises.

<strong>Getting the assignment files.</strong> 

On your scf account make a pa2 directory and cd into it.
The following command will copy the necessary files to your current directory:
<pre>
gmake -f ~csci455/assgts/pa2/Makefile getfiles
</pre>
<p>

The files in <strong><tt>bold</tt></strong></a> below are ones you
 create and/or modify and submit.  The ones not in bold are ones that
 you will use, but not modify.  The files are:

<ul>

<li><a href="SolitaireBoard.java"><strong><kbd>SolitaireBoard.java</kbd></strong></a> The
<a href="#interface">interface</a> for the <kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd> class; it
contains stub versions of the functions so it will compile.  It also
  contains some named constants.  You will
be completing the <a href="#impl">implementation</a> of this class.
You may not change the interface for this class, but you may add
private instance variables and/or private methods to it

  <li><a

<a name="certification">
<li><a href="README"><strong><kbd>README</kbd></strong></a>
See
section on <a href="#submit">Submitting your program</a> for what to
put in it.  Before you start the assignment please read the following 
statement which you will be "signing" in the README:


<blockquote>
"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, with the exception of the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."
</blockquote>

</a>


</ul>

<a name="run"><h3>Note on running your program</h3>

You will be using <kbd>assert</kbd> statements in this program.  To be
able to use them, you need to <em>run</em> the program with asserts enabled
(-ea flag).  (You do not need to compile it any special way.)  Here is
an example:

<pre>
java -ea BulgarianSolitaireSimulator
</pre>

You should run with this flag set every time.
<p>
Assert statements are another
tool to help us write correct code.  More about how you are using them
here in the section on <a href="#invar">representation invariants</a>.
<p>
NOTE: In Eclipse you use the Run Configurations settings (in the Run
menu) to change what arguments are used when running a program.  You
will be using both <em>program arguments</em> (more details in the
next section) and <em>VM arguments</em> when running this program;
<kbd>-ea</kbd> is a VM argument. (NOTE: VM stands for virtual machine,
as in the Java Virtual Machine, which is what you are running when you
do the "java" command.)
<p>

<a name="assgt"><h3>The assignment</h3>
</a>

You will be implementing a program to model the game Bulgarian
Solitaire.  This program will run in the console window and will not
have a GUI.  This is problem P7.4 from our textbook Big Java: Early
Objects, 6th Edition, by Cay Horstmann.  Here is his description of
the problem (second paragraph is a paraphrase):

<blockquote>
The game starts with 45 cards.  (They need not be playing cards.
Unmarked index cards work just as well.)  Randomly divide them into
some number of piles of random size.  For example, you might start
with piles of size 20, 5, 1, 9, and 10.  In each round you take one
card from each pile, forming a new pile with these cards.  For
example, the starting configuration would be transformed into piles of
size 19, 4, 8, 9, and 5.  The solitaire is over when the piles have
size 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order.  (It can be shown
that you always end up with such a configuration.)
<p>
In the normal mode of operation your program will produce a random
starting configuration and print it.  It then keeps applying the
solitaire step and printing the results, and stops when the final
configuration is reached.
</blockquote>
<p>
We recommend you finish playing Horstmann's example game, started
above, to see how it comes out (you can do it with just pencil and
paper).  (Save your work because it's part of the associated lab assignment.)
<p>

To make it easier to test your code, your program will be able to
be run in a few different modes, each of these controlled by a
command-line argument.  The user may supply one or both of the
arguments, or neither.

  <dl>
    <dt><strong><kbd>-u</kbd></strong>
    <dd> Prompts for the initial configuration from the user, instead
    of generating a random configuration.
<p>
  <dt><strong><kbd>-s</kbd></strong>
    <dd> Stops between every round of the game.  The game only
    continues when the user hits enter (a.k.a., return).
 </dl>

Command-line argument processing is discussed in section 11.3 of the
  Horstmann text.  But to make things a little easier, we wrote the
  code for processing the command-line arguments for you.  It appears in
  starter code you get in the <kbd>main</kbd> method in <a
  href="BulgarianSolitaireSimulator.java"><kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator.java</kbd></a>.

Here are a few examples of ways to run the program in the Unix shell:
<pre>
java -ea BulgarianSolitaireSimulator -u
java -ea BulgarianSolitaireSimulator -u -s
java -ea BulgarianSolitaireSimulator
</pre>

[Note: recall you are using the <kbd>-ea</kbd> argument for assertion-checking.
  The arguments after the program name are the ones that get sent to
  your program.]
<p>
There are more details about exactly what your output should look like
in each of these operation modes in the section on the <a href="#prog"><kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd> program</a>.
<p>
  
Some of the requirements for the program relate to efficiency,
testing, and style/design, as well as functionality.  They are described
in detail in the following sections of the document, and then summarized <a
href="#summary">near the end</a> of the document.

<a name="interface"><h3>SolitaireBoard: interface</h3>

What follows is the specification for the SolitaireBoard class.  You
  must implement the following methods so they work as described: 
<dl>
<dt>
<strong> <kbd>SolitaireBoard()</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Creates a solitaire board with a random initial configuration.
<p>

  <dt>
<strong> <kbd>SolitaireBoard(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; piles)</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Creates a solitaire board with the given configuration.  
Example values: [20, 5, 1, 9, 10].  <br>
 Precondition: <kbd>piles</kbd> contains a sequence of positive numbers that sum to
<kbd>SolitaireBoard.CARD_TOTAL</kbd>
<p>

<dt>
<strong><kbd>void playRound()</kbd></strong>
<dd>
      Plays one round of Bulgarian solitaire.  Updates the configuration according to the rules
      of Bulgarian solitaire: Takes one card from each pile, and puts them all together in a new pile.
      The old piles that are left will be in the same relative order as before, 
      and the new pile will be at the end.
<p>

<dt>
<strong><kbd> boolean isDone()</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Returns true iff the current board is at the end of the game.  That is, there are <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd>
piles that are of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd> in any order.
<p>

<dt>
<strong><kbd>String configString()</kbd></strong>

<dd> Returns current board configuration as a string with the format of
      a space-separated list of numbers with <em>no leading or trailing spaces</em>.
      The numbers represent the number of cards in each non-empty
      pile.  Example return string: "20 5 1 9 10"
  </dd>
<p>

</dl>
<p>

In addition, we have defined two public named constants for you:
<dl>
 <dt>
<kbd><strong>static final int CARD_TOTAL</kbd></strong>
<dt>
  <kbd><strong>static final int NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd></strong>
<dd>
We have defined two public named constants for you,
  <kbd>CARD_TOTAL</kbd> (45) and <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd> (9).
  Please write all of your code in terms of these constants, so that
  your program will still work if their values are changed.  You
  should also test your code with different values for
   <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd>.  For games that will terminate, the sum of the numbers
  from 1 to <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd> must equal <kbd>CARD_TOTAL</kbd>, so we have set
  <kbd>CARD_TOTAL</kbd> to be a value computed from
  <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd>.  So, for example, if you
  change  <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd> to 4, <kbd>CARD_TOTAL</kbd> will automatically have the value 10.  See
  comments in <a href="SolitaireBoard.java"><kbd>SolitaireBoard.java</kbd></a> for more details.

</dl>

Note: No <kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd> methods do any I/O.
<p>

You may have noticed that there is another method,
<kbd>isValidSolitaireBoard</kbd>, that's <kbd>private</kbd>, i.e., not part of
the public interface.  We will describe that <a
 href="#invar">later</a> after we discuss the representation.
<p> 

You may not change the public interface for this class, with the following
exception: you may add a public <kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd> <kbd>toString</kbd>
method that you may want to use for debugging purposes.  It would
be very short and mostly consist of call to the <kbd>toString</kbd> method(s) of its
constituent part(s).  That way you can see if you are building your
<kbd>SolitaireBord</kbd> object correctly, even before you implement
<kbd>configString</kbd>.  Section 9.5.1 of the textbook has more about
writing a <kbd>toString</kbd> method.  Hint: to get a String
representation of an array, use <kbd>Arrays.toString</kbd>
<p>

<a name="impl"><h3>SolitaireBoard: representation/implementation</h3>
</a>
For the purposes of this assignment you are required to use an array
to represent the piles of cards in your solitaire board (each array
element is one pile).  <strong>You may have additional fields, but you may not
use an <kbd>ArrayList</kbd></strong>.  This is going to be a partially-filled
array.  However, different from other situations where the number of
elements in an array can change size, in this application there is an
upper bound on the number of elements, so if you allocate your array
in the constructor using that upper bound, you'll never have to resize
it later.  You'll figure out what that upper bound is once you think
about the problem a little.
<p>
The reasons for this requirement are (1) to give you more practice with
using arrays, (2) because the array capacity won't have to change (as
described in the previous paragraph), and (3) if you want to write the most
efficient solution (see <a href="#extra">extra credit section</a>
below) using the ArrayList doesn't really make it any easier.
<p>

<a name="invar"><h3>Representation invariants</h3>

Many of the development techniques we discuss in this class, for
example, incremental development, the use of good variable names, and
unit-testing, are to help enable you to write correct code (and make it
easier to enhance that code later).  Another way to ensure correct
code within a class is to make explicit any restrictions on what
values are allowed to be in a private instance variable, and any
restrictions on relationships between values in different instances
variables in our object.  Or put another way, making sure you know what
must be true about our object representation when it is in a valid
state.  These are called <em>representation invariants</em>.
<p>

Representation invariants are 
statements that are true about the object as viewed by the implementor.  Since for many
classes, once a constructor has been called the other methods can be
called in any order, you need to ensure that none of the constructors
or mutators can leave the object in an invalid state.  It will be
easier to do that if you know what those assumptions are.
<p>

There are two assignment requirements for your SolitaireBoard class related to
this issue listed here, and described in more detail right after that.

<ol>

<li> in a comment just above or below your private instance variable
definitions for SolitaireBoard, list the representation invariants for
the object.

<li> write the private <kbd>boolean</kbd> method <kbd>isValidSolitaireBoard()</kbd> and
call it from other places in your program as described below.

</ol>

<strong>1. The representation invariant comment for <kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd></strong>

<br>

Write a list of all the conditions that the internals of a
SolitaireBoard object must satisfy.  That is, conditions that are
always true about the data in a valid SolitaireBoard object.  For
example, one or more invariants would describe where the data is in a
partially filled array (we did a similar example in lecture on 2/6).
Another one (or more) would be related to the restriction that there
are always <kbd>CARD_TOTAL</kbd> cards on the board.
<p>

<a name="valid"></a> <strong>2. <kbd>isValidSolitaireBoard()</kbd>
method</strong>

<br> 

This private method will test the representation invariant for the
internals of a solitaire board.  It will return true iff it is valid, i.e., the
invariants are satisfied.

<p>
Call this function at the end of every public SolitaireBoard method,
including the constructors, to make
sure the method leaves the board
in the correct state.  This is one kind of sanity check: one part of a
program double-checking that another part is doing the right thing (similar
to printing expected results and actual results).
<p>

Rather than putting this test in an if statement, we're going to put
it in an <kbd>assert</kbd> statement.  For example:

<pre>
assert isValidSolitaireBoard();
</pre>

  Assert statements are described
in Special topic 11.6 of the text.
<p>

Please make sure you are running your program with assertions enabled
for every run of this program, since it's in a development stage.  See
earlier <a href="#run">section</a> for how to do this.

You won't really know if they are getting checked unless you
force one to fail.
<p>

The point of these assert statements is to notify you in no uncertain
terms of possible bugs in your code.  The program
crashing will force you to fix those bugs.  For example, if a board
doesn't have <kbd>CARD_TOTAL</kbd> (45) cards on it, then the simulation may never
terminate, or if the array has "hole" in the middle, then other
methods, such as <kbd>configString</kbd> may not work as advertised.
<p>

<a name="prog"><h3><kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd> program</h3>
</a>

Please take a look at this example for what your output must look like.
This shows (part of) a run of
the program with the <strong><kbd>-u</kbd></strong> option turned on
(<kbd>-u</kbd> stands for <strong>u</strong>ser input mode.)
It also
illustrates the error-checking.  User input is shown in bold and
the ". . ." below represents some steps not shown here.

<pre>
Number of total cards is 45
You will be entering the initial configuration of the cards (i.e., how many in each pile).
Please enter a space-separated list of positive integers followed by newline:
<strong>40 1 1 1 1</strong>
ERROR: Each pile must have at least one card and the total number of cards must be 45
Please enter a space-separated list of positive integers followed by newline:
<strong>44 b 1 x</strong>
ERROR: Each pile must have at least one card and the total number of cards must be 45
Please enter a space-separated list of positive integers followed by newline:
<strong>100 -55</strong>
ERROR: Each pile must have at least one card and the total number of cards must be 45
Please enter a space-separated list of positive integers followed by newline:
<strong>0 45</strong>
ERROR: Each pile must have at least one card and the total number of cards must be 45
Please enter a space-separated list of positive integers followed by newline:
<strong>40 1 1 1 1 1</strong>
Initial configuration: 40 1 1 1 1 1
[1] Current configuration: 39 6
[2] Current configuration: 38 5 2
[3] Current configuration: 37 4 1 3
. . .
[30] Current configuration: 10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
[31] Current configuration: 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Done!
</pre>

Here is an example of what your output should look like with the
<strong><kbd>-s</kbd></strong> option turned on
(<kbd>-s</kbd> stands for
<strong>s</strong>ingle step mode).
The -u option is not set in this
example, so it uses a random initial configuration.
Again, only part
of the run is shown here.  After each
"<kbd>&lt;Type return...&gt;</kbd>" the program blocks until the user hits the return
key.

<pre>
Initial configuration: 9 4 6 26
[1] Current configuration: 8 3 5 25 4
&lt;Type return to continue&gt;
[2] Current configuration: 7 2 4 24 3 5
&lt;Type return to continue&gt;
[3] Current configuration: 6 1 3 23 2 4 6
&lt;Type return to continue&gt;
. . .
[26] Current configuration: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10
&lt;Type return to continue&gt;
[27] Current configuration: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 8
&lt;Type return to continue&gt;
Done!
</pre>

If <em>neither</em> argument is set, then the program will take no user input,
and just show the initial configuration followed by the numbered result of each round until it finishes
(i.e., output like the second example above, but without the lines
that say "&lt;Type return...&gt;").
<p>

A correct program will always terminate.  For some values of <kbd>SolitaireBoard.CARD_TOTAL</kbd> 
a game won't terminate; so do not change the initialization expression that sets this value
based on the current value of
<kbd>SolitaireBoard.NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd> (the code to do that is already present
in the starter version); this way it should still terminate even if you
change <kbd>NUM_FINAL_PILES</kbd> to some other positive value.
<p>

<strong>
Your output for a particular input must match what's shown above
character-by-character</strong> (e.g., the messages displayed and the
error handling should be the same), so we can automate our tests when
we grade your program.  This means the new piles must appear in the
particular order shown, not only in how they are printed, but the order
of the numbers in the <kbd>String</kbd> returned by the
<kbd>SolitaireBoard</kbd>'s <kbd>configString</kbd> method.


<p>

<a name="error"><h3>Error checking required</h3>

You are required to check that the list of numbers entered are
actually all numbers (integers) and represents a valid configuration.
Section 11.2.7 of the text discusses how to use a Scanner to check
whether a string is a valid integer.  The previous section showed
examples of invalid input, and what the program's response should be.

<a name="lineinput"><h3>Converting a String into an array of numbers</h3>

In user mode, you will not be able to read in the numbers directly
into an ArrayList of integers using repeated calls to
<kbd>nextInt</kbd>, because we're using newline as a sentinel (i.e., a
signal that that's the end of the input data), and <kbd>nextInt</kbd>
skips over (as in, doesn't stop for) newlines.  So you'll want to
first read the input all at once using the <kbd>Scanner</kbd>
<kbd>nextLine</kbd> method, and then convert them to an ArrayList of
integers.
<p>

How do we do such a conversion?  Section 11.2.5 of the textbook
(called Scanning a String) shows one way of solving the problem of
processing an indeterminate number of values all on one line.  It
takes advantage of the fact that the <kbd>Scanner</kbd> class can also
be used to read from a <kbd>String</kbd> instead of the keyboard.
Once we have our String of ints from the call to
<kbd>nextLine()</kbd>, you create a <em>second</em> <kbd>Scanner</kbd>
object initialized with this string to then break up the line into the
parts you want, using the Scanner methods you are already familiar
with.
<p>

<a name="struct"><h3>Structure of <kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd></h3>

The code for <kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd> is too long
to be readable if you put it all
into the <kbd>main</kbd> method.  One could design and add another
class, to deal with the simulation, but instead here you'll use a procedural
design to organize the code; we'll review procedural design here.
<p>

A good design principle (for procedural as well as object-oriented
programming) is to keep each of your methods small, for easier
program readability.  In object-oriented programming, the class design
sometimes naturally results in small methods, but sometimes you still
need auxiliary private methods.
The same principles apply for
a procedural design.  Since we haven't given you a predefined method
decomposition for the <kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator</kbd>, you will have to create
this decomposition yourself.
<p>

A procedural design in Java is just implemented as <kbd>static</kbd>
methods in Java that pass data around via explicit parameters.  Static
methods are discussed in Section 8.4 of the text, and this use of them
was also discussed in a <a
href="../../labs/lab4/lab4.html#static">sidebar in Lab 4</a>.  You
have seen a few examples of this in other test programs we have
written, for example <a
href="../../labs/lab4/NumsTester.java"><kbd>NumsTester.java</kbd></a>
of lab 4, and <kbd>PartialNamesTester.java</kbd> we developed in
lecture.  You have also seen some utility classes in Java that have
static methods: <kbd>Math</kbd> and <kbd>Arrays</kbd>.

<p>
If you have learned about procedural design in other programming
classes, you know that global variables are a no-no.  This is another
example of the principle of locality.  Thus, in designing such a "main
program" class, we don't create any class-level variables, because
they become effectively global variables (see also <a
href="../style.html" target="_blank">Style Guideline</a> #9).  The
"main class" does not represent any overall object.  Instead you will
create variables <em>local</em> to <kbd>main</kbd> that will get
passed to (or returned from) its helper methods, as necessary.  <p>
Note: the next section discusses a limit on method length as one of
our style guidelines for this course.
<p>

Another design issue that comes up often in both object-oriented and
procedural designs is code reuse.  You've seen a couple examples of
one kind of code reuse in lecture where we've created a parameterized
method that generalizes some action to avoid repeating code, calling
the method every time we need to do that action instead.  For example,
<kbd>doOneLookup</kbd> in <kbd>PartialNamesTester</kbd> from the
lecture on 2/1.  In
particular, for this assignment, if there are four possible modes in
which the program can be run (i.e., two flags that can be turned on
and off independently), a good solution would <em>not</em> repeat the
same code four times!  Imagine, if we added two more options, we'd
have to have it repeated sixteen times!
<p>

As we've discussed in lecture: one clue is if you find yourself
writing the same or similar code sequence multiple times, it may be an
indication that there's a better (and shorter) way to do it.
<p>

<a name="scanner"><h3>A note about the <kbd>System.in</kbd> <kbd>Scanner</kbd></h3>

This (and all Java programs that read from the console) should only
have one <kbd>Scanner</kbd> object to read from <kbd>System.in</kbd>.
If you make multiple such Scanner objects your program will not work
with our test scripts.  You will also have problems if you try to open and
close multiple Scanners from System.in in your code.  Once you create that one
Scanner, you can pass it as a parameter to other methods to be able to
use it in different places.  Here is a little program with an example of
this:

<pre>
public class MyClass {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);  <strong>// create the Scanner</strong>
      . . .
      int dataVal = in.nextInt();  <strong>// using "in" directly in main</strong>
      . . .
      // readAndValidateString will also read some more input
      String moreData = readAndValidateString(in); <strong>// pass "in" as a parameter here</strong>
      . . .
   }

   // prompts for a String from "in", reads it, and validates it.
   private static String readAndValidateString (Scanner in) { 
      <strong>// don't create another Scanner for Sytem.in here; use the parameter instead</strong>
      . . .
      String theString = in.next();
      . . .
      return theString;
   }
   . . .
}
</pre>

As you may know by now, you can create <kbd>Scanner</kbd> objects that
have different data sources.  We are not saying you can only have one
<kbd>Scanner</kbd>, but rather that you should only have one that was
created using <kbd>new Scanner(System.in)</kbd>.

<a name="summary"><h3>Summary of requirements</h3>

As on the first assignment, there are several requirements for this
assignment related to design, testing, and development process strewn
throughout this document.  We'll summarize those and the functional
requirements here:

<ul>

<li> implement SolitaireBoard class according its public interface (see <a
href="#interface">SolitaireBoard: interface</a>)

<li> use the representation for SolitaireBoard described in the
section <a href="#impl">about that</a>.

<li> write <a href="#invar">representation invariant</a> comments for
SolitaireBoard class.

<li> implement and use private SolitaireBoard method <kbd>isValidSolitaireBoard</kbd> as described 
<a href="#valid">here</a>.

<li> implement BulgarianSolitaireSimulator with the user interface described in the section
about the <a href="#prog">BulgarianSolitaireSimulator program</a>.

  <li> only use the expression <kbd>new Scanner(System.in)</kbd>
  at most <em>once</em> in your program (see <a href="#scanner" >
  previous section</a>)

<li> do the error checking described in the <a href="#error" >Error
  Checking section</a>.

<li> your code will also be evaluated on style, documentation, and design.
We will deduct points for programs that do not follow the published <a
 href="../style.html" >style guidelines</a> for this course (they are
also linked from the Assignments page).  (Note: For pa1 we only
deducted points for problems related to <em>some</em> of the style
guidelines.)  One guideline we want you to be especially aware of is the limit of 30
lines of code at most allowable in a method.  This is exclusive of
whitespace, comment lines, and lines that just have a curly bracket by
itself (i.e., you should not sacrifice code-readability to make your
code fit into this limit).  Hopefully, it's obvious that putting
  multiple statements or declarations on a single line decreases code
  readability and is not desirable; that would also result a loss in style
  points.

<p>
  For these "style" points we will also take into account the general quality of
  your design (e.g., see hints in the previous section).

<a name="extra"><h3>Extra credit</h3>

We won't be discussing big-O until nearer the due date, so we're making
this one part extra credit:  You will receive a small amount of extra
credit if your <kbd>playRound</kbd> and <kbd>isDone</kbd> methods execute in time linear in
the number of piles (i.e., O(<em>n</em>)) and if your <kbd>playRound</kbd> uses
a constant amount of extra space (e.g., it does not allocate a new array).
However, your <kbd>isDone</kbd>
method may use more space to meet the O(<em>n</em>) time requirement.
<p>
If you are a student who is struggling in the class or starting the
program on the late side, I recommend not attempting the extra credit,
or only doing so if you have extra time after you have a complete
working program (and save a backup of that working program).
<p>

<a name="submit"><h3>README file / Submitting your program</h3>

You will be submitting <kbd>SolitaireBoard.java</kbd>, <kbd>BulgarianSolitaireSimulator.java</kbd>, and
<kbd>README</kbd>.  Make sure your name and loginid appear at the
start of each file.
<p>

Here's a review of what goes in the README:  This is the place to
document known bugs in your program. That means you should describe
thoroughly any test cases that fail for the the program you are
submitting.  (You do not need to include a history of the bugs you
already fixed.)  You also use the README to give the grader any other
special information, such as if there is some special way to compile
or run your program.  You will also be signing the <a href="#certification" >certification</a> 
shown near the top of this document.
<p>

Reminder: if you developed your code locally on your laptop, before
submitting you will need to upload your code to aludra, and
compile and re-test it there before submitting it from aludra.
<p>

As you did for pa1, to submit your code: from the aludra directory that
contains your completed assignment and the pa2 <a
href="Makefile">Makefile</a>, do the Unix command:

<pre>
gmake submit
</pre>

at the Unix prompt.
